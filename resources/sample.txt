This is a sample resource file for example-plugin (example-plugin).

You can read this file from your plugin code using:

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const resourcePath = path.join(__dirname, 'resources', 'sample.txt');
const content = fs.readFileSync(resourcePath, 'utf8');

You can add any text-based content here that your plugin might need,
such as templates, default configurations, or help information.
